# FFF_Free_Food_forever
 Automated spirulina bioreactor. Might get as common as a fridge.
 
This is my take on solving world unger. 

Spirulina is nutritive and is cheap and easy to grow. Making a spirulina bioreactor could continuously produce a food source with minimal ressources. 

This project feasibility as been evaluated in some steps. 
1. nutritonal values of some easily grown microorganisms
2. requirements to grow such organism.
3. growth rate and volume needed to achieve sustainable food source quantity. 
4. manual extraction methods and potential of automation
5. options for processing the microorganism into food.
6. maintaining the micro-organism population health and purity/avoiding contamination
7. expantion and commercialisation options. 

The required characteristics for this project's sucess : 
1. Free access to all related information
2. easily reproduceable design using no special parts or patented technologies
3. adaptability of the core components to a wide range of secondary parts (for exemple, the light source should be efective no matter if the tank used is clear or not, sealed or not or if its as random as a bath tub) 
4. No one cares if it taste bad or if its risky. make it work, then someone will make it not suck.
5. consider availlable free resources in your area. (in canada, we have good sun and temperatures half the year and we have free clean water. My design will take advantage of that)
6. ideas sould be tested, not just spoken.

The design is divides in sections: 
1. lighting
2. nutrient control
3. colony wellbeing(what does spirulina really needs to live well)
4. gas/air management(air filter and pump, microbubler etc.)
5. water intake management
6. extraction 
7. slurry processing
8. product storage 
9. product rationning
10. growth rate control(pruning, splitting colonies, storing live cells for later inoculation etc.)
11. sterilization
12. self-cleaning/maintenance requirements
13. waste management
14. safety features
15. part serialization/ aquirement(making a shoping list)
16. documentation
