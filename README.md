Automated spirulina bioreactor. When your refrigerator also make your food.
 
This is my take on solving world unger. 

Spirulina is nutritive, cheap and easy to grow. Making a spirulina bioreactor could continuously produce a food source with minimal ressources. 

Current status : 
working prototype with some manual input. 
Total cost is less than 300$ and can be lowered.
working cost is pretty low : 
  less than 7$/month of electricity
  cost of growth medium is uncertain now. seems to be less than 30$/months.
  in canada, water is free, but elsewhere it should be taken into account.

To make your own : 
1. gather all the parts listed in the parts list.
2. order a pcb on jlcpcb with the Gerber Files for the motherboard
3. order a spirulina starter kit or get some live culture from a friend. 
4. assemble the parts following the instructions. electronic soldering is required.
5. load the software on the microcontroller following instructions. 
6. prepare the growth medium and make sure the system is working properly.
7. begin spirulina culture.
8. wait until the population is dense enough
9. consume the extracted spirulina every days or discard of the surplus.

Spirulina reliability as food source.
It is far from a perfect food source, but it is better than fast food. 100L should be barely enough to survive on. 
with a 200L culture, you should produce about 40g of dried spirulina every day. with that amount, following vitamins are produced. (percentage of recommanded daily values)

Vtamin A	retinol 	15%							
Vitamin B1	79%
Vitamin B2	113%
Vitamin B3 32%
Vitamin B5	28%
Vitamin B6	11%
Vitamin B7	125%
Vitamin B9	0%
Vitamin B12	1100%
Vitamin C	4%
Vitamin D 0%
Vitamin E 13%
Vitamin K	9%

As stated, it is definetly not a perfect or proper food source, but it is way better than nothing. Calories should come from some other food, but it is not hard to come-by for cheap. 

Taste 
When rinsed properly, fresh and mixed with water, it feels and taste like drinking water.
