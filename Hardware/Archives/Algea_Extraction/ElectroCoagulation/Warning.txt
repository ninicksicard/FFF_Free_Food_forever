Electrocoagulation require the dissolution of metal in water. the process will thus require the subsequent extraction of the iron. 
this could possibly be done with a magnet at one of the next processing stages; after the extraction, after the griding to break cells, after the drying and "powederisation". 

To Note that the cobalt from Cobalamin(vitamin B12) is ferromagnetic and could possibly be removed by the same process.
